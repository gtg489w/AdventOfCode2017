## Disclaimer
Spoiler alert! Don't look at these if you want to ruin the excitement of puzzling yourself.

You're also agreeing to not critique style or efficiency. This was done quickly to solve the problem and use my time efficiently. Hopefully the code works for your sample input as well. Note that if you get a .5 on Day 3... round up.

## Setup
Everything is in node. You shouldn't need to install anything else.
